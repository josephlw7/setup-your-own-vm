# Create a VM lab

## Your first VM
Reflection #1 - VM installation
 What OS is your VM running? Ubuntu

 What challenges did you face while creating your VM? What troubleshooting steps did you take to resolve those challenges and what did you research?
The instructions weren't completely clear. I was able to get it working after a few tries. I Googled the instructions. Those steps didn't work. I reached out for support from my instructor. I had to re-install the VM then I could get the Unbuntu download to install from the D: drive.

How much RAM and hard disk space did you allocate to your VM? 4GB and 32GB
 Why did you choose these amounts? To make sure the VM will run fast enough and not lag. 

What do you think would happen if you allocated too much RAM to your VM? 
It could caused glitches and impact performance on the host, because there isn't a good balance of resource allocation between host and VM. Creating an imbalance. 

Reflection #2 - Configuring your Ubuntu VM
What settings did you change and why? I changed the 3D acceleration and allocated the max amount of video memory. To be able to improve the graphics performance
How did your VM perform before and after changing the settings? 
Unfortunately after many attempts, research, and troubleshooting steps I was not able to implemnt these changes. 
What other settings do you think could be important for optimizing a VM’s performance? Adjusting the CPU and memory allcation to find the right balance. Make sure the VMware Tools are installed and up to date. 

## Your second VM
Reflections #1
What OS is your VM running? Windows 10

What challenges did you face while creating your VM? I didn't have any challenges this time like I did last time. I learned from my first VM and I was able to set up this VM quickly and efficiently. 

 What troubleshooting steps did you take to resolve those challenges and what did you research? I didn't have any challenges following the instructions and setting up this VM. It was bit more challenging and time comsuing when I had to set up Windows without a Product Key. I had to go through a number of steps to finally have access to the set up desktop.

How much RAM and hard disk space did you allocate to your VM? 4 GB
 Why did you choose these amounts? To ensure there was enough available RAM to keep the VM running smoothly.

What do you think would happen if you allocated too much RAM to your VM? I believe allocating too much RAM would causes glitches with the VM or make it sluggish. 

Reflections #2
What settings did you change and why? I attended to make setting changes. I followed the instructions to click on Devices and select Insert Guest Additions CD Image and nothing happened. I went back and check setup. It look good. I followed all the steps. I don't knwo why I can't get anything to happen when I do this. 

How did your VM perform before and after changing the settings? The VM was and is performing well for the before. I unfortunately don't have an after to compare it with since I was not able to make the changes, reboot the VM and text it. I went back multiple time to the instructions and I made sure I followed them exactly as shown. 
What other settings do you think could be important for optimizing a VM’s performance?
Use fixed Virtual Hard Disk files to ensure efficient disk and network configurations. Prioritize allocating a good portion of the host's RAM to the VM.
