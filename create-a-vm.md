# Create a VM lab

## Your first VM
Reflection - VM installation
 What OS is your VM running? Ubuntu

 What challenges did you face while creating your VM? What troubleshooting steps did you take to resolve those challenges and what did you research?
The instructions weren't completely clear. I was able to get it working after a few tries. I Googled the instructions. Those steps didn't work. I reached out for support from my instructor. I had to re-install the VM then I could get the Unbuntu download to install from the D: drive.

How much RAM and hard disk space did you allocate to your VM? 4GB and 32GB
 Why did you choose these amounts? To make sure the VM will run fast enough and not lag. 

What do you think would happen if you allocated too much RAM to your VM? 
It could caused glitches and impact performance on the host, because there isn't a good balance of resource allocation between host and VM. Creating an imbalance. 

Reflection - Configuring your Ubuntu VM
What settings did you change and why? I changed the 3D acceleration and allocated the max amount of video memory. To be able to improve the graphics performance
How did your VM perform before and after changing the settings? 
Unfortunately after many attempts, research, and troubleshooting steps I was not able to implemnt these changes. 
What other settings do you think could be important for optimizing a VMâ€™s performance? Adjusting the CPU and memory allcation to find the right balance. Make sure the VMware Tools are installed and up to date.
